  # The usage convention for samplicate is:
  #   $ samplicate [<option>...] [<destination>...]
  #
  # The following <option> parameters are available:
  #   -d <level>       to set the debugging level
  #   -s <address>     to set interface address on which to listen for incoming packets (default any)
  #   -p <port>        to set the UDP port on which to listen for incoming packets (default 2000)
  #   -b <buflen>      size of receive buffer (default 65536)
  #   -c <configfile>  specify a config file to read
  #   -x <delay>       to specify a transmission delay after each packet, in units of microseconds
  #   -S               maintain (spoof) source addresses
  #   -n               don't compute UDP checksum (only relevant with -S)
  #   -f               fork program into background
  #   -m <pidfile>     write the process ID to a file
  #   -4               IPv4 only
  #   -6               IPv6 only
  #   -h               to print a usage message and exit
  #   -u <pdulen>      size of max pdu on listened socket (default 65536)
  #
  # Each <destination> is specified as <addr>[/<port>[/<interval>[,ttl]]]
  #   <addr>  IP address of the receiver
  #   <port>  port UDP number of the receiver (default 2000)
  #   <freq>  number of received datagrams between successive copied datagrams for this receiver.
  #   <ttl>   The TTL (IPv4) or hop-limit (IPv6) for outgoing datagrams.

  # The following services are examples for forwarding common UDP packets to multiple sources.
